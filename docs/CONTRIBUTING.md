* Ensure that the changes are consistent with the [coding style](#Coding_Style_Guide).
* In case of a larger feature, provide relevant unit tests and sample.

## Coding Style Guide

We mainly follow the [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) with
the following exceptions:
* Pointer and reference alignment style: left
* The number of spaces before trailing line comments: 1

[clang-tidy](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/) is used to enforce the coding style check.
